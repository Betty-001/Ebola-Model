# Ebola-Model
Ebola is a virus that causes a highly virulent infectious disease that has plagued Western Africa, impacting Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea heavily in 2014. Understanding the spread and containment of this disease is vital to its containment and eventual elimination. In this paper, we formulate and analyze a mechanistic SIFR type outbreak model, to simulate the transmission of the disease. The model is validated with data from the World Health Organization. Optimal control theory is used to explore the effect of vaccination on the SIFR model. The goal is to explore the use of these control strategies to effectively contain the Ebola virus. Codes and graphs are written and generated in Python.

The flow of the SIFR model is below: (S-Susceptible, I-Infectious, F-Funeral, R-Removed)
